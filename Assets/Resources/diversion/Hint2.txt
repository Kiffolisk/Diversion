Walking in mud is like...um...well.. like walking in mud!
Remember three important things: Timing, Timing, and Timing!
Avoid the flames that come out of fire vents! Time your jump!
Sometimes you may want to save some boost for later ;)
Get ready! It's time to take on another mini-boss!
Don't make the mistake to not learn from your mistakes!
Mutant Space Sharks! Jump over them, not into them!
Feel like a change? Switch your gender in the character menu!
Zoom! Zoom! Zoom! Time flies when you're having fun!
Super Slide! Here comes another Mini-boss!
Watch out! Some steam vents are on-again off-again!
Sometimes it's good to fall.
May I present... our 'fall' collection.
Sometimes you need to plan ahead.
Jump activated turrets should make short work of a Mini-Boss!
The most obvious path isn't always the best. Experiment!
Jelly-Blobbers! Jump on these flatulent things only from above!
Green buttons mean good or on.  Red means bad or off... usually.
Weeeeeeee! Zip and slide!
Guess what?! That's right! Another Mini-Boss!
Take note of your surrounding, you don't want to get lost!
Don't get the axe... Watch that backswing!
Jump continuously to almost walk on water!
Did you know that Jelly-blobbers are re-jump-on-able?
Time for a change in pace... and another mini-Boss
Sometimes, when you don't think it's not safe to not jump - it isn't!
Keep your eyes open and your wits about you!
Shields don't last forever!
Okay! Now try not to get motion sickness!
It's time to fire the Boss!
